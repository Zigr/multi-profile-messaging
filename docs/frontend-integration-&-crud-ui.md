## Scope

This thread covered the design and implementation of the frontend layer for **multi-profile messaging (MPM)**, with emphasis on:

- UI migration to **React 18 + TypeScript**
- Adoption of **Vite** as the build tool
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing
- **Chakra UI v3** for component styling
- **TanStack Query** for API integration and data fetching
- CRUD UI flows for Templates, Profiles, and Lists

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Frontend Stack**
   - React 18 + TypeScript (instead of JS).
   - Vite chosen for faster builds and better DX.
   - TanStack Router with **file-based route generation** adopted as the routing strategy.
   - Chakra UI v3 used as the primary component library.

2. **State & Data Layer**
   - TanStack Query integrated for API fetches and mutations.
   - CRUD operations wired against backend endpoints (`/profiles`, `/templates`, `/lists`).

3. **UI Components**
   - Profiles Page: list, create, edit, delete profile entries.
   - Templates Page: mirrored CRUD pattern for templates.
   - Lists Page: included CRUD for whitelist/blacklist management.

4. **Extended Features**
   - **Bulk Uploader**: file input component posting to `/lists/bulk`.
   - **Download CSV template**: client-side CSV generation with example schema.

5. **Tooling**
   - TanStack Router Devtools: updated import path (`@tanstack/react-router-devtools`) in v1.131.16.
   - Addressed TypeScript issues with Chakra’s typings and prop forwarding.

---

## Outcomes

- Frontend now structured around **file-based routes** for maintainability.
- CRUD UI for Templates, Profiles, and Lists implemented with Chakra components.
- Backend integration tested via TanStack Query hooks.
- Extended usability via CSV upload/download features.

---

## Pending / Open Points

- SMTP Settings CRUD UI (not implemented yet).
- Worker Control endpoints (start/stop campaigns) not wired into UI.
- Authentication & Profile association remains a backend+frontend task.

---

## Lessons Learned

- TanStack Router requires careful alignment with generated `routeTree.gen.ts` and version changes.
- Chakra v3 introduced breaking changes in prop typing (`spacing` handling, `shouldForwardProp` deprecations).
- Developer experience improved once React Query + Router + Chakra were harmonized.

---

**Status:** ✅ CRUD UI for Profiles, Templates, Lists complete.
**Next thread:** **Playwright automation** (Generic cookie capture).
